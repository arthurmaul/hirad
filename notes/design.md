- Everything in the syntax of Hirad is an expression.
- Each expression is made of a actor, scalar, vector, or matrix.
- Actors are atom objects with a record, a type and a protocol
- Expressions represent a list of signal arguments sent to an object.
- There are two forms to expressions
    - parameter expressions have a target and parameter signature, ie (Type new int) or (num + 3).
    - keyword expressions have a target and a keyword signature, ie (target keywords)
- Each object has a protocol that describes what messages it understands.
- The symbol ; is the cascade operator, so where (obj a; d) -> ((obj . b) (obj . d))
- The symbol : is the cons operator, so where (a: b c: d) -> ((a . b) (c . d))
- Accessors are unary messages.
